# SIRE Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery (BC/DR) strategies for organizations implementing a Secure Isolated Recovery Environment (SIRE) in Microsoft Azure. Following the Azure Business Continuity Guide methodology, this document structures BC/DR planning into three phases: **Prepare**, **Application Continuity**, and **Business Continuity**.

The guidance aligns with the [Azure Well-Architected Framework Reliability pillar](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/reliability/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) and incorporates latest Microsoft Learn best practices for [disaster recovery strategy design](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/reliability/disaster-recovery?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).

## BC/DR Framework Overview

The SIRE BC/DR framework follows Microsoft's recommended three-phase approach:

1. **Phase 1: Prepare** - Fundamental concepts, assessment templates, and planning foundations
2. **Phase 2: Application Continuity** - Application-specific assessment, implementation, and testing
3. **Phase 3: Business Continuity** - Organization-wide coordination and management

### Alignment with Azure Business Continuity Guide

This guide implements the structured methodology from the [Azure Business Continuity Guide](https://github.com/Azure/BusinessContinuityGuide), providing templates and processes for consistent BC/DR planning across your organization.

*Comprehensive diagram showing business-aligned service classification with infrastructure allocation and cost optimization strategies*

Organizations must classify applications based on business criticality to direct appropriate investment in business continuity, monitoring, and support resources.

#### Application Classification Framework

**Criticality Scale Definition:**

| Criticality Level | Business Impact | Availability SLA | RTO Target | RPO Target |
|------------------|----------------|------------------|------------|------------|
| **Mission-Critical** | Immediate business shutdown, safety risk, or regulatory violation | 99.99% | ‚â§ 1 hour | ‚â§ 15 minutes |
| **Business-Critical** | Significant business impact, customer service disruption | 99.9% | 2-8 hours | 1-4 hours |
| **Important** | Moderate business impact, operational efficiency reduction | 99.5% | 8-24 hours | 4-8 hours |
| **Non-Critical** | Minimal business impact, administrative convenience | 99.0% | 24-72 hours | 8-24 hours |

**Enhanced Criticality Assessment Criteria:**

**Mission-Critical Systems require immediate attention if they involve:**
- **Life Safety**: Systems that directly impact human safety or emergency response
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Systems required for legal or regulatory compliance
- **Revenue Generation**: Direct revenue-generating systems or customer-facing services
- **Public Safety**: Systems that support emergency services or public safety
- **Operational Dependencies**: Systems that other critical systems depend on

**Business-Critical Systems support core operations:**
- **Core Business Processes**: Primary business applications and workflows
- **Customer Service**: Customer support, service delivery, and communication
- **Financial Operations**: Payment processing, financial reporting, and accounting
- **Supply Chain**: Inventory management, logistics, and vendor relationships

- Microsoft Defender for Cloud dependency visualization

#### Business Impact Analysis

For each application, document:

1. **Revenue Impact**: Financial impact per hour of downtime
2. **Customer Impact**: Number of affected customers and service degradation
3. **Regulatory Impact**: Compliance violations and reporting requirements
4. **Operational Impact**: Effect on dependent systems and business processes

**BIA Template:**
```markdown
### Application: [Application Name]
- **Annual Revenue Dependency**: $X
- **Revenue Impact/Hour**: $X
- **Customer Base Affected**: X users/customers
- **Regulatory Requirements**: [List applicable regulations]
